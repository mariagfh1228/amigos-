Lyrics

Version #1

Disco, go-go dancer so rare
Move down, up slow, prostitute stare
I do what I like, I just don't care

I am my only God, mmm
I am my only God, oh, oh
I am my only God now

Black eyes, short dress, let's break it down
You shoot and I pose, Polaroid frown
I'll do what you like, I won't make a sound

I am my only God
I am my only God, mmm, mmm, mmm
I am my only God now

Icon, young star, heroin fiend
Just sit and I'll sing, I'll be your queen
You know how I like that celebrity type
Hold me, hmm

I am my only God, ow
I am my only God
I am my only God now
